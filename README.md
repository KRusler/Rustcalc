# Rustcalc
A basic calculator written in rust using slint UI

This project is not to be taken seriously, it is simply a repo for me to learn Rust and Slint by making a basic calculator app.
Do not expect fast or consitant updates to this, nor should you expect this to be maintained for a long period of time.

If you have any advice for making the code more efficient or would like a feature added, feel free to let me know through an issue or a pull req. However I cannot garentee I will be able to get to it.
